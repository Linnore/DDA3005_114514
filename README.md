**Note**: Though we did not report PhaseIIB-optional in our report, we did implement it in our framework. It
    suffers from the accuracy issues. One can envoke our PhaseIIB-optional by `SVD.svd(myMat, phaseII="B2")`.

## Notes of the data folder:

Please download these datasets from BB and put them under the data folder manually. Please do not push the data onto this repo (cuz they are large). The `.gitignore` under root directory of this repo should be able to ensure this.

## A Sample Platform for Video Extraction 
The platform is developed by us. The url is https://3170project.streamlit.app. We have deployed our algorithm and svd algorithm for Problem 3 on the platform. You can try different algorithm to extact the background.
